@2040=~Scimitar~
@2041=~The long, curved, single-edged blade is characteristic of both the saber and the scimitar, even though their origins lie in different parts of Faer√ªn. Whereas the saber was intended chiefly for horsemen, mainly due to its versatility, the scimitar has a heavier oriental influence. The "shamshir," as it was originally called, is larger, more highly curved, and tapered to an elongated, sharp point. This makes the weapon slightly slower but more effective and deadly in combat.

@2050=~Short Sword~
@2051=~The short sword is the first type of sword to come into existence. In the simplest of terms, a short sword can be considered a dagger with a blade so long that it can no longer be called a dagger. The term short sword does not exist in sword classifications. However, it has come to be used to describe a double-edged blade about two feet in length. The sword tip is usually pointed, ideal for thrusting.

@2052=~Kundane +2~
@2053=~Sword of Quickness: Kundane
Disfigured as a child, Dramnek Olk was ostracized and ridiculed by his peers. In his loneliness he spent many hours alone on the hills overlooking Trademeet. A nearby wizard, Galloma, discovered the youth and found in him a kindred soul. The two fast became friends; master and apprentice. Galloma died before Dramnek's tutorage could be completed, however, and the youth found himself once more alone in the world. Eventually he made his way to the streets of Athkatla. There he became a cutpurse, augmenting his thieving skills with the little magic he'd learned from Galloma. Eventually he crafted this sword, which enhanced Dramnek's weak physical body. This weapon has no speed factor.
